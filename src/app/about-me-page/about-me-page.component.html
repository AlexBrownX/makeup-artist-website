    <p class="padded-text">I am Jana, a professional freelance makeup artist based in London and the South East. I started my fashion business in 2008 and studied makeup at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/">London College of Fashion</a>. I have also completed many short courses with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.illamasqua.com/" alt="Illamasqua professional makeup">Illamasqua</a>, a beauty range.</p>
    <p class="padded-text">A very creative and artistic individual, I have been passionate about makeup and beauty since a young age. I remember helping my girlfriends with their makeup, hair and even style their outfits since I was a teenager.
      I really enjoy experimenting with new looks and styles. To compliment my wedding makeup passion, I also have experience with beauty, fashion, fitness, fetish, glamour, lingerie, pin up, and Halloween makeup.</p>
    <p class="padded-text">My passion for wedding makeup blossomed when friends and family started asking me to do their makeup for them. This was both an honour and a privilege and allowed me to see exactly how a wedding is one of the most important and memorable days in a persons life. Women from all over the world want to look their best for their big day. Wedding makeup should give a bride confidence insuring she looks and feels like the very best version of herself. Being a part of your special day is a unique experience for me seeing all the stunning brides, gorgeous and happy on their special day, is now my biggest joy and achievement.</p>
